Hello everyone,

I’m thrilled to share a project I’ve been working on that delves into the critical challenge of customer churn prediction. This project demonstrates my expertise in data analytics and machine learning, leveraging advanced methodologies to generate actionable insights and deploy predictive solutions. Designed to empower businesses with proactive retention strategies, this project is organized into four comprehensive stages:

**1. Problem Framing and Target Definition**
One of the key challenges was the absence of a predefined churn label. To address this, I established a synthetic target by defining churn as customers with no transactions in the last 8 months prior to the dataset’s end date. This step required:

**Business Alignment**: Ensuring the target definition reflected real-world operational goals.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw dataset to support accurate modeling and analysis.
Target Validation: Conducting sanity checks to ensure that the synthetic target was robust and aligned with expected business patterns.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
A thorough EDA was conducted to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Key highlights include:

**Demographic Analysis**: Unveiling the impact of factors like age groups and geographic segments on churn propensity.
Transactional Behavior Analysis: Exploring frequency, recency, and monetary trends to identify customer segments at risk.
Engagement Insights: Investigating behavioral attributes, including customer preferences and attitudinal trends, to create a holistic profile of churners.
The EDA not only provided critical business insights but also informed feature engineering and model selection.

**3. Feature Engineering and Predictive Modeling**
Building on the insights from EDA, I crafted a robust predictive model using advanced machine learning techniques:

Feature Engineering: Designing high-impact features such as average transaction value, recency, and frequency to capture nuanced customer behaviors.
Model Training and Tuning: Experimenting with multiple algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting) to achieve a balance of precision, recall, and overall accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics like F1 score, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrices to validate model performance and ensure reliability in real-world scenarios.

**4. Actionable Insights and Strategic Recommendations**
The final stage translated data-driven insights and model predictions into actionable strategies:

**Retention Focus**: Identifying high-risk segments and suggesting targeted interventions, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers.
**Resource Allocation:** Prioritizing efforts on customers with the highest lifetime value at risk of churn.
**Performance Monitoring:** Recommending dashboards and tracking tools to continuously monitor churn rates and improve interventions.
